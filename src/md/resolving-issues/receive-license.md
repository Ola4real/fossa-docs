# Receiving Licenses

Throughout software development, you will often find that you use Open Source projects licensed under terms/obligations that you cannot satisfy or are incompatible with your use case.  Therefore, you must either cease using the
project or attempt to get new terms.

Most of these cases can be resolved by contacting the authors of the project
to grant a separate, private license.  For this purpose, the **FOSSA Private License (FPL)** is available below, but you can use any license that satisfies the following qualities:

1. **Private Between two Parties**

	Typical Open Source licenses are fantastic for grants to the general audience, but don't make sense when it's in the context of two parties (i.e. you and the author).  The type of license to look for should specify two parties specifically.

2. **Broad, Retroactive and Perpetual**
  
  Make sure you choose a license that boardly applies across all versions of a peice of software.  That way, you don't have to update to newly licensed versions, but instead can directly gain rights to use all versions including future releases. 

3. **Retains traditional Open Source license features**

  Many developers will be resistent to licenses they are unfamiliar with.  Make sure you choose a license which preserves the goals and interests of the Open Source developer.  The FPL includes disclaimers and attribution features for the authors that make it functionally similar to popular permissive licenses like the MIT License.


## The FOSSA Private License (FPL)

The FOSSA Private license is a short-form document crafted by our Open Source lawyers specifically for private license requests to Open Source authors.

This form of agreement is provided as a courtesy by FOSSA.  This is provided without warranty; consult your attorney on what license the best fit is for you.
