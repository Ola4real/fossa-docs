# Slack Integration

This guide is for you to set up the FOSSA app in your Slack channel(s).

## Set up Application Link

You first need to authorize FOSSA to access your Slack team.

1. Navigate to FOSSA [Integration Settings](/account/settings/integrations).

2. Connect to Slack

**NOTE: You can set this up for as many channels as you'd like.

Now teams can successfully connect their FOSSA projects with Slack.

## Set up Project Notifications

Now that Slack channel settings are configured, you will need to enable Slack Notifications on a project by project basis.

To change your project notifications, simply navigate to the settings tab of your project, and select which notifications you would like to be enabled for your Slack channel.
