# Getting Live Help

At any point you can contact FOSSA support by clicking the chat bubble in the bottom-right corner of your screen.

If no support member is available live, feel free to email [support@fossa.io](mailto:support@fossa.io) and we'll assist you as soon as we can.

You can also email support to receive a list of all the Open Source projects that used to create FOSSA.  This can normally be found in the root directory alongside any standard distribution of FOSSA.
